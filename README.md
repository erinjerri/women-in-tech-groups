# Women in Tech Groups

// This is an uncomprehensive initial list of some women in tech groups, many based in the San Francisco Bay Area/Silicon Valley, some that are national with affiliate chapters throughout the country and world, not all are engineering and technical, and some are more entrepreneurial oriented than others. I've also separated some by sector/subfield/discipline/role.

Due to popular demand by the Taro (YC backed company) women in tech Slack channel community and everyone and their mom who has asked me over the years "what/how do I get involved in x y z group" (a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ), I've compiled a new list, something more updated than the Bay Area Women in Tech repo. 

This is NOT a complete list by any means, but here are some I am or of which I have been an active member or leader.
